The game [d0x3d!] is a non-digital game developed primarily for education 
and STEM outreach. The digital materials for [d0x3d!] are released here, 
as open-source products. These materials are of two forms:

tgc-print
=========
Contains SVG and 300dpi PNG artwork, in a format appropriate to print using 
The Game Crafter (http://thegamecrafter.com/), i.e. full-bleed artwork for 
TGC print house.


self-print
==========
Contains SVG and 300dpi PNG artwork, masked so it can be directly printed 
and cut-out at home (no margins for cut or bleed).

The deck mixtures are as follows:
 * [patch!] deck: one of each card (24 total)
 * [hacker] deck: one of each card (6 total)
 * [lo0t!] deck: 28 cards total, in the following mixture:
    - one of each honeypot and intrusion dectected card (3 total)
    - one of each zero-day exploit card (5 total)
    - five of each digital asset share (20 total)

We recognize our self-print process is currently not very user-friendly.
We are interested in improving it, and you might consider helping us.
