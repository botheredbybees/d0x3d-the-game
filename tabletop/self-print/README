These files are for printing and assembling [d0x3d!] at home.

Different methods of assembly can be employed, based on the quality of printer you own. If your printer aligns front-to-back when printing double sided with very little error, then it may be possible simply to print 'scale to fit,' double-sided, on linen paper and then cut out the pieces. Alternatively, sheets can be printed individually, then glued together using spray adhesive while carefully aligning front-to-back, then cut out. See 'Assistance for print-and-play games' for advice.

Additional print-and-play editions created by users can be found under the 'contribs' directory.
