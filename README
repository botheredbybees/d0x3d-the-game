[d0x3d!] was created as a non-digital game for education. As a table top game it was entertaining, but any education around networks, privacy and security had to be provided by the teacher/game master. 

By making an online version of [d0x3d!] I hope to achieve 2 things:
1. Allow for the addtion of factual elements (ideally as part of the game play)
2. Provide an engaging learning experince for my Certificate IV Web Development class at TasTAFE

The web content can be found in the html directory. Background information, plans and tutorials for the design and coding can be found in the repository wiki (https://github.com/botheredbybees/d0x3d-the-game/wiki)

The digital materials for the original [d0x3d!] card based game were released  
as open-source products by the great folk at TableTopSecurity (https://github.com/TableTopSecurity). Those materials are in three forms:

tgc-print
=========
Contains 300dpi PNG artwork, in a format appropriate to print using 
The Game Crafter (http://thegamecrafter.com/), i.e. full-bleed artwork for 
TGC print house.


self-print
==========
Contains 300dpi PNG artwork, masked so it can be directly printed 
and cut-out at home (no margins for cut or bleed).

The deck mixtures are as follows:
 * [patch!] deck: one of each card (24 total)
 * [hacker] deck: one of each card (6 total)
 * [lo0t!] deck: 28 cards total, in the following mixture:
    - one of each honeypot and intrusion detected card (3 total)
    - one of each zero-day exploit card (5 total)
    - five of each digital asset share (20 total)

We recognize our self-print process is currently not very user-friendly.
We are interested in improving it, and you might consider helping us.
